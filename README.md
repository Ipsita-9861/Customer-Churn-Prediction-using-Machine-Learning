# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning:

This project aims to construct a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer will churn based on their demographic, account, and service-related data. 
The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts whether a customer will churn. We will attempt to build a model that helps the company identify customers who are at a high risk of churning.

   # Summary:

   In this Project, I observe that in today's highly competitive business environment, retaining customers is a critical factor for long-term success. Predicting customer churn      can help organizations take proactive steps to retain customers, thus minimizing revenue loss.
